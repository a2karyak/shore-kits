1. Installing
-----------------------

a. Prerequisites
-----------------------

- Download and compile Shore-mt. 

- Link ~/apps/shore to the base dir for shore-mt

#> ln -s <shore-mt-dir> ~/apps/shore 



b. Compiling
-----------------------

#> ./autogen.sh
#> CXX=CC ./configure
#> gmake -j



-----------------------
2. Running
-----------------------

a. Edit shore.conf
-----------------------

In order to populate a new database set db-clobberdev=1. 
(if opening an already populated database set db-clobberdev=0.)
Follow instructions at shore.conf.



b. Run shore_kits
-----------------------

#> ./shore_kits



c. List of commands
-----------------------

i. The three basic commands for running experiments:

measure - Executes a specific workload for a specific duration.
          The user can set the number of clients, whether the requests will be spread, the
          number of iterations, the scaling factor, and the thread binding policy.


test    - For a specific workload each client executes a specific number of transactions.
          The user can set the number of clients, whether the requests will be spread, the
          number of iterations, the scaling factor, and the thread binding policy.
          WARNING: The 'test' command is innacurate in terms of the reported throughput.

trxs    - Lists the transactions supported by the current workload.



ii. Additional commands:

break   - Breaks into a debugger by raising ^C (terminates program if no debugger is active)
cpu     - Process cpu usage/statitics
echo    - Echoes its input arguments to the screen
help    - Prints help
iodelay - Sets the fake I/O disk delay
quit    - Quits
stats   - Print statistics
trace   - Sets tracing level


iii. Help:

help     - Prints the list of additional commands 
help cmd - Prints cmd-specific information 



c. Usage example:
-----------------------

Assuming a 10wh TPC-C database.

- Execute 5 iterations of 1min runs of 20 clients running the TPC-C Mix.

(tpcc-base) measure 10 0 20 60 0 5 0


- Run 2 iterations of 30secs runs of 10 clients submitting only TPC-C NewOrder 
  transactions, and each client uses a different warehouse.

(tpcc-base) measure 10 1 10 30 2 1 




-----------------------
3. Notes
-----------------------

a. Re-populate a database:
-----------------------

In case of errors during powerruns, it is faster to re-populate a new database 
than wait for recovery to finish. Shore when it starts always first tries
to recover. Therefore, the log files should be deleted if the user wants to
re-populate a benchmark database.

- Set db-clobberdev=1 at shore.conf
- Delete any log files at the corresponding log directory (files at <db-config>-log dir)
- Run shore_kits
- Reset db-clobberdev=0 *before* re-running shore_kits



-----------------------
4. Known Bugs
-----------------------

B1. The probes using an iteration on TPCC.C_NAME_INDEX cause a seg fault. 
Until fixed define USE_SAFE_PATHS in src/workload/tpcc/tpcc_input.cpp
