     *  @param packet_id The ID of this packet. This should point to a
     *  block of bytes allocated with malloc(). This packet will take
     *  ownership of this block and invoke free() when it is
     *  destroyed.
     *
     *  @param output_buffer The buffer where this packet should send
     *  its data. A packet DOES NOT own its output buffer (we will not
     *  invoke delete or free() on this field in our packet
     *  destructor).
     *
     *  @param output_filter The filter that will be applied to any
     *  tuple sent to output_buffer. The packet OWNS this filter. It
     *  will be deleted in the packet destructor.
     *
     *  FDUMP doesn't really need a tuple filter. All filtering for
     *  the query can be moved to the stage feeding the FDUMP. The
     *  caller should be able to get away with creating an instance of
     *  the tuple_filter_t base class.
     *
     *  @param filename The name of the file to scan. This should be a
     *  block of bytes allocated with malloc(). This packet will take
     *  ownership of this block and invoke free() when it is
     *  destroyed.
     *
     *  @param notifier An optional notify_t instance that the worker
     *  thread will invoke notify() on when the FDUMP operation is
     *  complete. Pass NULL to avoid this behavior. Even if a non-NULL
     *  value is passed, this packet WILL NOT take ownership of this
     *  object. We will however, invoke notify() on this parameter in
     *  our destructor.
